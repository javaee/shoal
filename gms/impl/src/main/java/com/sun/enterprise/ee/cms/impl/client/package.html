      <h1>Shoal GMS's reference implementations of the client-side 
      <code>ActionFactory</code> and <code>Action</code> sub-types</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>This package contains reference implementations of the various 
          <code>Action</code> and <code>ActionFactory</code> sub-type interfaces. 
          These are provided for convenience purposes. Clients are free to have 
          their own implementations of these interfaces should there be a need 
          for a different implementation.</p>
          <p>A specific <code>ActionFactory</code> sub type produces a 
          corresponding <code>Action</code> sub type. For instance, a 
      <code>FailureNotificationActionFactory</code> produces a 
  <code>FailureNotificationAction</code> instance. An <code>Action</code>
  sub type consumes a corresponding <code>Signal</code> sub type. A 
  <code>Signal</code> sub type stands for a specific group event. For instance,
  the <code>FailureNotificationAction</code> consumes a 
  <code>FailureNotificationSignal</code>. GMS generates a specific 
  <code>Signal</code> sub type's implementation in each member process for a given 
    group event and passes it to the corresponding <code>Action</code> 
    instance(s) in a separate thread.</p>
