/**
 * Produces Action instances. This pattern enables implementors

 * flexibility to produce Actions from either a pool or by creating 
 * a new instance each time or by using a Singleton, etc.
 *
 * The method <code>produceAction</code> will be called before delivery
 * of Signal to the Action "produced."
 *
 * Each instance of an Action is guaranteed to be served an instance 
 * of Signal on a separate thread.
 *
 * If the ActionFactory always returns the same Action instance, that
 * instance should be written to take into account the possibility of multiple
 * threads delivering distinct signals.
