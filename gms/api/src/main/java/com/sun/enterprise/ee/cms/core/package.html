      <h1>Shoal GMS's core client API</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>Shoal's client API is provided in this package. The entry point for 
          clients using GMS is the <code>GMSFactory</code> class. This class 
          provides the APIs for getting a <code>GroupManagementService</code>
          instance for a given member name, group name, member type and 
          configuration. The <code>GroupManagementService</code>
          instance provides methods for registering interest in specific group 
          events. 
      </p>
      <p>To process group events on the client side, Shoal makes it easy for 
          clients by providing a single interface that needs to be implemented, 
          namely, the <code>CallBack</code> interface. This interface provides a
          method <code>processNotification()</code> that accepts a <code>Signal</code>
          object. Signals are of various types - each type corresponding to a 
          specific group event. Clients register interest in these events by 
          using <code>addActionFactory()</code> methods provided in 
          <code>GroupManagementService</code>. The clients pass in an instance 
      of a specific <code>ActionFactory</code> type to the method.</p>
      <p>The <code>ActionFactory</code> is a client side artifact with its 
      sub-types corresponding  to a specific group event. One can think of the 
      <code>ActionFactory</code>-<code>Action</code>-<code>Signal</code> triplet
as a set of one-to-one correspondence objects for a specific type of group event. 
Clients can choose to implement a specific <code>ActionFactory</code> and 
<code>Action</code> type or use the reference implementations provided in the 
    <code>com.sun.enterprise.ee.cms.impl.client</code> package.</p>
    
    <p>For instance, clients simply implement the CallBack interface and register 
        for group events using the default implementation of the, say, 
        <code>FailureNotificationActionFactory</code> to receive notifications for 
    failure events in the group.</p>
