/**
 * Raises exceptions occuring while acquiring signals.
 * If such an exception is raised, a deadlock on group resources
 * through concurrent acquisition of distributed resources
 * is prevented
 *
 * For example, if <code>FailureRecoverySignal</code> throws a
 * <code>SignalAcquireException</code>, it means that the failed server
 * has returned to operation or that it may not be possible to fence it
 * out of the group. This will indicate a group condition wherein
 * control of resources is atomically defined such that it may be acceptable
 * for most group communication environments for continuing operations.
